# Pentagonal Fractal OpenGL


## Objectives  
The main objective of this assignment was to develop a 2D graphical application based on a modern graphics system. To achieve this, the use of the modern OpenGL Application Programming Interface (API) was suggested, along with libraries such as the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW), Graphics Library Framework (GLFW), and OpenGL Mathematics (GLM).

Each student was tasked with creating a fractal, with the type of fractal assigned based on the last digit of their student ID number. In my case, as my ID ends in 5, I was assigned to develop a pentagonal fractal, based on a quadrilateral (4-sided) shape.
